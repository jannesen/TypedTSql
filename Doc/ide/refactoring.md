# Refactoring

The Typed T-SQL extension in visual studio supports refactoring. Including refactoring of tables, column, etc.<br/>
In the case of a table, column refactoring, extended_properties are added so that [DBTools](https://github.com/jannesen/DBTools) can follow the refactoring when generating a patch script.
